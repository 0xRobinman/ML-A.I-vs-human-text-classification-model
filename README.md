# A.I vs Human text classification model
This was a fun project I recently tested out due to my fascination with detecting A.I-generated content. The dataset being used was a fairly small dataset, so I was not expecting very high accuracy. <br><br>The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alejopaullier/daigt-external-dataset/data (MIT).
